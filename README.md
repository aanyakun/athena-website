What This Project Is: 

This project is a website called Athena Website that helps you figure out what to do when youâ€™re bored! You can look through fun activity ideas and click a button and get a fun random activity idea instantly, making this interactive!. This site is very colorful and bright, meant to make people happy.

Why I Made It:
I made this to help people (including myself!) beat boredom, especially on lazy weekends or long school breaks. I wanted something simple that actually gave useful suggestions instead of scrolling through the same social media apps.

Â How I Built It: 
I built it using HTML for structure, CSS for styling (colors, fonts, layout), and JavaScript for interactivity (random activity button)
I created it in VS Code and hosted on GitHub Pages

Â What I Learned & Challenges

I learned how to use JavaScript in an interactive way to create a working "activity generator."

I figured out how to make my site responsive and visually clean.

I struggled a bit with centering and formatting the text/buttons, and connecting the GitHub repo to a working live page.

I also learned how to organize and push a working HTML/CSS/JS project into GitHub and make a good README file!

Â Final Thoughts
This was a super fun project and I loved combining my creativity with code. Iâ€™d love to expand it one day with more advanced features like user customization, more user inputs or animations!
